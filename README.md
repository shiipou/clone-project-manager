### üìã Requirements

This tool has minimal dependencies, but to maximize its potential, we recommend the following tools for an optimized development workflow:

- **VSCode** with the [Project Manager Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.project-manager)
- **NeoVim** with the [ProjectMgr Plugin](https://github.com/charludo/projectmgr.nvim) (for NeoVim users, [NVChad](https://nvchad.com) is recommended as a configuration base)

### üÜï Quick Installation

#### Option 1: Direct Download

Download the latest release of the `clone` binary from the release section and place it in one of your PATH directories (e.g., `~/bin/clone`).

Install it in one step with `curl`:

```sh
curl -fSLo /usr/local/bin/clone https://github.com/shiipou/clone-project-manager/releases/latest/download/clone-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)
```

Ensure that `/usr/local/bin` is part of your system's `$PATH`.

#### Option 2: Cargo Installation

Alternatively, if you use [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), you can install it directly from crates.io:

```sh
cargo install clone-project-manager
```

> *Tip*: You can specify the version by adding the `--version` argument if needed.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

After installing, ensure the binary is executable by running:

```sh
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/clone
```
